## Quick Start

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/reazon-research/OpenArm.git
```

## About

This repository outlines all the necessary materials and software required in order to build, setup, and deploy OpenArm. Examples to assist with robot simulation setup in Genesis and Gazebo environments and support for tele-operation with bilateral feedback implementation are provided.

The CAD for the OpenArm v1 project can be accessed on OnShape through the following link: 
- [OnShape](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/b4c9f28b9b00f7d40a1a4250/w/fe370058f6ecce02af3b0093/e/c7e7f88d1c11b5ea0a83ba7c?renderMode=0&uiState=67b590ed2d89b65cc3bf2317)

Machined, sheet metal, and off-the-shelf components can be purchased through MISUMi and Misumi and its manufacturing service Meviy, but similar services worldwide can also be used to procure the necessary parts. The Purchasing List/Bill of Materials can be found on the OnShape, as well as the Assembly Guide. 

## 💾Software

### 🦾Arm Control
OpenArm’s software stack includes real-time motor control examples, enabling users to quickly set up and start moving the arm. It also provides motor calibration tools, a SocketCAN driver, and a step-by-step tutorials on setting up the CAN interface.
